      <h2>About</h2>
      <hr class="sep-bar">

      <p>Our solar cooker projects involved installing solar cookers for poor rural farmers in remote areas of China to replace coal for cooking and hot water needs, which considerably reduced the expenses on purchasing coal and improved the indoor air quality by avoiding coal smoke. So far our projects have benefited hundreds of thousands low-income rural people and generated several million high-quality carbon credits.

      <p>The project brochure can be downloaded from <a href="solar cooker project.pdf">here</a>.</p>

      <p>Because of their significant social and environmental value, our projects attracted prestigious parties as project participant and carbon credit buyer. The following are some examples:</p>

            <p>Using coal stove involves a lot of work on handling the coal, such as purchasing coal, getting coal to home, storing coal, breaking the coal, igniting the coal, and cleaning the coal ashes and dust, etc. These work were mostly done by women in the households. The use of solar cooker saved households, especially women, considerable time that would have been used for handling the coal.</p>
